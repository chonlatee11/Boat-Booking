## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Milestone 1 = Phases 1-5, dependency-forced chain (Foundation → Identity+Catalog → Schedule → Booking Core → Payment+Ticket+Notification), matches seed Phase 0-4 and research SUMMARY.md
- Payment provider (Opn vs 2C2P) deferred to a sandbox spike at Phase 5 planning
- Kong 3.9.1 DB-less JWT sufficiency deferred to a spike at Phase 1 planning (Traefik fallback if it fails)
- [Phase 01]: Kong 3.9.1 DB-less passed the D-28 spike on the first attempt (all 8 roundtrip checks) — no Traefik fallback needed

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 is highest-leverage and highest-risk: shared `pkg/*` template is copied into every later service — a mistake here compounds across all 7 services (per research/SUMMARY.md)
- Phase 5 combines payment + ticket + notification + deploy intentionally (no useful partial-completion state for the saga) — largest phase by requirement count (15)

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and deferred at milestone close, most recent first:
