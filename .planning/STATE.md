## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Milestone 1 = Phases 1-5, dependency-forced chain (Foundation → Identity+Catalog → Schedule → Booking Core → Payment+Ticket+Notification), matches seed Phase 0-4 and research SUMMARY.md
- Payment provider (Opn vs 2C2P) deferred to a sandbox spike at Phase 5 planning
- Kong 3.9.1 DB-less JWT sufficiency deferred to a spike at Phase 1 planning (Traefik fallback if it fails)
- [Phase 01]: Kong 3.9.1 DB-less passed the D-28 spike on the first attempt (all 8 roundtrip checks) — no Traefik fallback needed
- [Phase 01]: buf toolchain: pinned protocolbuffers/go v1.36.12, connectrpc/go v1.18.1, bufbuild/es v2.15.0 remote plugins; gen/go and gen/ts committed — Exact tags verified against proxy.golang.org rather than trusting illustrative versions from planning
- [Phase 01]: pkg/clock/pkg/money TDD RED phase used a genuine Go build failure (undefined symbols) for a brand-new package, not a compiling-but-wrong stub — Idiomatic Go TDD for greenfield packages; confirmed intentional (target symbols only, no unrelated errors) before GREEN
- [Phase 01]: franz-go pinned to v1.21.7 and goose to v3.27.3 instead of the plan's illustrative v1.22.0/v3.28.0 (both require go1.26.0, breaking the Go 1.25.x pin).
- [Phase 01]: deploy/redpanda/topics.sh default RPK_BROKERS changed to 127.0.0.1:9093 (Redpanda's internal listener) instead of localhost:9092 — the external listener advertises the host-mapped port, unreachable from inside the same container.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 is highest-leverage and highest-risk: shared `pkg/*` template is copied into every later service — a mistake here compounds across all 7 services (per research/SUMMARY.md)
- Phase 5 combines payment + ticket + notification + deploy intentionally (no useful partial-completion state for the saga) — largest phase by requirement count (15)
