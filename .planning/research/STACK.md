# Technology Stack

**Project:** Boat-Booking (ferry/boat departure booking platform, Thailand island crossings)
**Domain:** Go microservices + Kafka event bus + database-per-service + Next.js PWA
**Researched:** 2026-09-25
**Confidence:** HIGH for versions/maintenance status (verified via web search against Sept 2026 sources), MEDIUM for payment provider recommendation (no hands-on sandbox test performed)

## Verdict on the Prescribed Stack

The stack in `PROJECT.md` §4 and `.planning/PROJECT.md` (Go 1.23+/chi/connect-go/sqlc+pgx/goose/franz-go/go-redis/slog/OTel, Postgres 16, Redis, Redpanda, Kong+BFF, buf, Next.js 15, Leaflet/Mapbox, skip2/go-qrcode+html5-qrcode, Resend/SES, Compose→Jenkins→ECR→EC2, Grafana LGTM) **mostly holds up**. Every core choice is still the standard, actively-maintained pick for this shape of system in Sept 2026. Three things need action before/at Phase 0-4, not a redesign:

1. **Kong OSS is frozen at 3.9.1** (HIGH severity — see Gateway section). Pin the image now or the "free" assumption silently breaks.
2. **`html5-qrcode` is unmaintained since 2023** (MEDIUM severity). Swap for `qr-scanner` (or native `BarcodeDetector` with fallback) before Phase 5 (check-in), no impact on v1.
3. **Next.js 15 is one major behind** (LOW severity, informational). Next.js 16 is current stable as of Sept 2026; starting fresh, prefer 16.

Everything else below is version-pinning and gotcha detail, not a stack change.

## Recommended Stack

### Core Technologies

| Technology | Version | Purpose | Why Recommended |
|------------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Go | **1.25.x** (module `go 1.25`) | Backend language, all 7 services + BFF | 1.25 is current stable (1.25.7 as of Feb 2026); connect-go v1.20+ already requires Go ≥1.25 as its minimum, so "1.23+" in the seed is now a floor you can't actually build on with current connect-go — bump the workspace `go.work`/`go.mod` to 1.25. Confidence: HIGH. |
| chi | **v5.3.2** (`github.com/go-chi/chi/v5`) | HTTP router + middleware for `pkg/httpx` and BFF | Actively maintained (last publish Aug 2026), zero deps, idiomatic `net/http` handler chain — fits the "thin BFF" role. Note: Go 1.22+ stdlib `net/http.ServeMux` now does method+wildcard routing natively, so chi's *routing* value is smaller than in 2022; you're really keeping it for its middleware ecosystem (`middleware.RequestID`, `Recoverer`, `Timeout`, compress). Confidence: HIGH. |
| connect-go | **v1.20.0** (`connectrpc.com/connect`) | Sync inter-service RPC (gRPC+HTTP/JSON+Connect in one handler) | Current stable; v1 module is supported indefinitely (v2 is beta on a separate module path, don't use it yet — API not final). Requires Go ≥1.25 (see above). Gives curl-able JSON debugging + generated Go/TS clients from the same proto, exactly the "sync API you can debug without grpcurl" requirement. Confidence: HIGH. |
| sqlc | **v1.31.x** | Generate typed Go from SQL + schema, per service | pgx/v5 support has been stable since sqlc 1.18 (years ago, not new/risky). Set `sql_package: "pgx/v5"` in `sqlc.yaml`. Confidence: HIGH. |
| pgx | **v5.x** (`github.com/jackc/pgx/v5`) | Postgres driver + pool | De facto standard high-perf Postgres driver for Go; use `pgxpool` per service, one pool per service DB/DSN. Confidence: HIGH. |
| goose | **v3.x** (`github.com/pressly/goose/v3`) | SQL + Go migrations per service | v3 is the actively tagged major; supports plain-SQL and Go-func migrations, works per-service with each service's own `migrations/` dir as the repo structure already plans. Confidence: HIGH. |
| franz-go | **v1.22.x** (`github.com/twmb/franz-go`) | Kafka/Redpanda client (producer + consumer) | Fastest, most CPU/memory-efficient pure-Go Kafka client; actively released (v1.22.0 shipped Sept 18 2026, weekly cadence). Confluent's `confluent-kafka-go` (cgo, wraps librdkafka) and `segmentio/kafka-go` (unmaintained-adjacent, no transactions) are both worse fits — see "What NOT to Use". Confidence: HIGH. |
| go-redis | **v9.19.x** (`github.com/redis/go-redis/v9`) | Redis client for seat-hold TTL, rate limit, OTP | v9 is the only maintained line; protocol-compatible with both Redis and Valkey (see Cache section — pick the server separately from the client). Confidence: HIGH. |
| slog | stdlib (Go 1.21+) | Structured logging, JSON handler | Already in stdlib, zero dependency, exactly what `pkg/httpx`/`pkg/kafka` need for `trace_id`-correlated JSON logs. Confidence: HIGH. |
| OpenTelemetry Go | **v1.47.0** (traces+metrics API/SDK), Logs SDK **now stable as of v1.47.0 (Sept 24 2026)** | Distributed tracing across HTTP + Kafka | Traces and metrics have been stable for a long time; Logs SDK just went stable literally this week (Sept 2026) — you can now use the OTel Go logs bridge with slog instead of a separate log shipper config, simplifying the Grafana Loki pipeline. Confidence: HIGH. |
| PostgreSQL | **17.x** (recommend over the seed's "16") | Primary datastore, database-per-service | 16 still fully supported, but greenfield + self-managed on your own EC2 (no RDS version lag to worry about) means there's no reason to start one major behind. 17 is the mature choice (18 shipped Sept 2025, is only ~1yr old — async I/O rework is real but newer/less battle-tested for a solo-maintained prod system). If you want the 18 read-throughput win, 18.6 is also fine; either way pin the exact minor and test `pg_upgrade` path before v1 launch. Confidence: HIGH on 17 being safe; MEDIUM on "18 vs 17" being purely a risk-tolerance call. |
| Redis (or Valkey) | Redis **8.x** (AGPLv3) or **Valkey 9.1** (BSD-3) | Seat-hold TTL + keyspace notifications, rate limit, OTP | See "Cache/Lock licensing" note below — both work unmodified with `go-redis/v9`. Confidence: HIGH. |
| Redpanda | **v25.x/26.x** current release, pin exact tag (e.g. `redpandadata/redpanda:v25.x.x`) | Kafka-compatible event bus, dev + prod v1 | Single binary, no ZooKeeper/KRaft split-brain to manage, Kafka-protocol compatible so franz-go needs zero code changes if you ever move to MSK. For single-node dev/prod-v1, run with `--overprovisioned --smp 1 --memory 512M-1G` per Redpanda's own single-broker lab config. Confidence: HIGH. |
| Kong Gateway | **kong:3.9.1 (OSS, pinned)** | API gateway: routing, TLS, JWT plugin, rate limit | **Critical gotcha, read the Gateway section below before Phase 0.** Confidence: HIGH on the licensing fact, MEDIUM-risk on whether Kong OSS is still the right pick given the freeze. |
| Next.js | **16.x** (App Router) — seed says 15 | Frontend PWA | Next.js 16.3 is current stable (Sept 2026); starting a greenfield project now, build on 16 not 15. React 19.2 features, faster dev-mode memory, `"use cache"` directive for the search/results pages that need to feel instant. If you specifically need 15's stability window for a reason not stated in the seed, 15 is still fine — just know you're one major behind day one. Confidence: MEDIUM (recommendation, not a hard fact — team may have reasons to stay on 15). |
| buf CLI | **v1.73.x** | Protobuf lint/breaking-check/codegen orchestration | Drives `protoc-gen-go`, `protoc-gen-connect-go` (Go, v1.18.1 via buf remote plugins), `@bufbuild/protoc-gen-es` (v2.14.1, TS message types) and `@connectrpc/protoc-gen-connect-es` (v1.7.x, TS Connect clients — **use the `@connectrpc/*` package, not the archived `@bufbuild/protoc-gen-connect-es`**, see below). Confidence: HIGH. |

### Supporting Libraries

| Library | Version | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `@connectrpc/protoc-gen-connect-es` | v1.7.x | Generate TS Connect clients for Next.js | Use this, not `@bufbuild/protoc-gen-connect-es` (last published ~3 years ago, effectively abandoned — the org moved to `@connectrpc/*` scope). |
| `@bufbuild/protoc-gen-es` | v2.14.x | Generate TS message types from proto | Pairs with the connect-es plugin above; both driven from one `buf.gen.yaml`. |
| `testcontainers-go` + `modules/postgres`, `modules/redpanda` | v0.44.x (lockstep) | Integration tests against real Postgres + Redpanda in CI | Exactly matches the seed's "integration ต่อ service กับ Postgres+Redpanda จริง" requirement — no fakes/mocks for the capacity-race test. Pin `postgres:17-alpine` and a specific `redpandadata/redpanda:vX.Y.Z` tag in the module `Run()` calls so CI doesn't silently pick up a new major. |
| `skip2/go-qrcode` | latest tag | Server-side QR generation for tickets | Still fine for v1 — pure Go, no deps, does exactly one job. If profiling later shows it's a hot path, `piglig/go-qr` is a 3-4x faster, zero-dependency drop-in with lower allocs — not needed at v1 scale (one QR per paid booking). |
| `qr-scanner` (nimiq) or native `BarcodeDetector` | latest | Staff-side browser QR scanning (Phase 5 check-in) | **Do not use `html5-qrcode`** — unmaintained since 2023, wraps the also-unmaintained `zxing-js`. `qr-scanner` is lighter, worker-based, actively used; fall back further to the native `BarcodeDetector` Web API (supported in Chrome/Edge/Android WebView, i.e. exactly the staff-tablet environment you'd deploy to at a pier) with `qr-scanner` as the polyfill path. Not urgent for v1 (check-in is Phase 5), but don't let the Phase 0 template wire up the dead library. |
| `resend-go/v3` (`github.com/resend/resend-go/v3`) | v3 (v4 also exists) | Transactional email (ticket, OTP) | Zero third-party runtime deps, simple `Emails.Send` API matches the seed's "email ตั๋ว (Resend/SES)" requirement directly. |
| `aws-sdk-go-v2/service/ses` | latest | Alternative/fallback email sender | Only if you need SES specifically (e.g. already on AWS SES sending reputation) — otherwise Resend's DX is strictly better for a solo dev. |
| `omise/omise-go` | latest (pub. Mar 2026) | Opn (Omise) payment provider Go client | See Payment Provider section — has a maintained webhook HTTP handler helper and native PromptPay charge support. |
| Leaflet + `react-leaflet` + OSM tiles | Leaflet 1.9.x | Map picker (admin) + route map (public search) | Free, no API key, matches "Leaflet/OSM ฟรี" in the seed. Use Mapbox only if you need styled/branded tiles or better Thai-language label rendering — OSM's Thai POI/label coverage is decent in tourist areas but patchier in smaller piers. |

### Development Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `buf generate` + `buf.gen.yaml` | Single command generates Go (service+events) and TS (web app) from `proto/` | Wire `make proto-gen` to this; commit generated code per the seed's repo structure (`gen/`) so CI doesn't need network access to buf's remote plugins on every run — or vendor the plugin binaries. |
| `testcontainers-go` | Spins up real Postgres/Redpanda per test run | Requires Docker-in-CI (Jenkins agent needs Docker socket access) — confirm the Jenkins agent AMI has Docker before Phase 0 is "done". |
| `golangci-lint` | Go linting across the workspace | Standard choice for multi-module Go workspaces; not in the seed explicitly but expected tooling — add in Phase 0 alongside `make new-service`. |
| Grafana Tempo/Loki/Prometheus (LGTM-minus-Grafana-Cloud) | Tracing/logs/metrics, self-hosted in Compose | Current LGTM stack images are fine to pin at latest-stable tags; no breaking gotchas found for this combination in 2026. The OTel Go Logs SDK going stable this month (see above) means Loki ingestion can go through the same OTel Collector pipeline as traces, instead of a separate log-shipping sidecar — simplifies the Compose stack by one moving part. |

## Gateway: Kong Licensing Gotcha (read before Phase 0)

**This is the single most important finding in this research pass.** Starting with Kong Gateway **v3.10**, Kong split the product: OSS-only images are frozen at **v3.9.1** as the last fully-free build. From 3.10 onward, running the `kong/kong-gateway` image without a paid license degrades to an expired-Enterprise state, not a full OSS mode. There is no more "free rolling-latest OSS" track.

**What this means for you:**
- If you build against `kong:latest` in `docker-compose.yml`, you will eventually pull a licensed-only image and things will silently misbehave or lock features.
- **Pin `kong:3.9.1`** (or whatever the final OSS tag turns out to be — verify against `Kong/kong` GitHub discussions before Phase 0) explicitly in the compose file, and treat any Kong upgrade as a deliberate decision, not `docker compose pull`.
- Kong OSS 3.9.1 still has DB-less mode and the JWT plugin (both used since v1 of Kong OSS, not new/enterprise features), so **the prescribed architecture (Kong + thin Go BFF, JWT plugin, DB-less declarative config) still works on the frozen OSS tag.** This is a pin-and-monitor issue, not a redesign.
- Because the seed's own root `PROJECT.md` §4 already lists **Traefik + Go BFF** as an equally-considered alternative ("หรือ Kong ถ้าต้องการ plugin"), and Traefik has no equivalent licensing cliff (Apache-2.0, no OSS/Enterprise split), it's worth a 30-minute spike before Phase 0 to confirm Kong 3.9.1's DB-less JWT plugin does everything you need — if it does, ship it pinned; if you hit an OSS-only limitation, Traefik + a slightly thicker Go BFF (JWT verification moves from Kong plugin into the BFF, which you're already writing) is a clean fallback with no rewrite of the service layer.
- Concrete Phase 0 config: DB-less Kong reads a single `kong.yml` declarative file (services, routes, `jwt` plugin per consumer/route, `cors`, `rate-limiting`) — no `kong-postgres` container needed, which also removes one moving part from the dev Compose stack (the seed's dev stack doesn't currently list a separate Kong DB, confirming DB-less was already the implicit intent).

## franz-go Patterns (per downstream request)

- **Producer side (outbox relay):** one `kgo.Client` per service configured with `kgo.ProducerBatchMaxBytes`, `kgo.RequiredAcks(kgo.AllISRAcks())`, and idempotent producer enabled by default in franz-go — the relay polls the `outbox` table, produces, and only marks rows sent after a successful `ProduceSync` (or batched `Produce` + wait), matching the "outbox in same tx as state, relay does the actual publish" design already in the seed.
- **Consumer side:** use `kgo.ConsumerGroup(serviceName)`, `kgo.ConsumeTopics(...)`, and **`kgo.DisableAutoCommit()`** — franz-go auto-commits by default, which the seed's guardrail explicitly forbids ("ห้าม auto-commit — commit หลัง apply สำเร็จ"). Call `cl.CommitRecords(ctx, records...)` (or `CommitUncommittedOffsets`) only after the consumer has written to `processed_events` and applied the projection in the same DB transaction. This is the standard "process-then-commit" pattern and is exactly what franz-go's manual-commit API is designed for.
- **DLQ:** on exhausting in-process retries (3, per the seed), produce the failed record + error metadata to `<topic>.dlq` using the same client, then commit the original offset anyway (don't block the partition) — franz-go doesn't have DLQ as a built-in feature, it's an app-level pattern of "produce to dead-letter topic, then commit forward."
- **Ordering:** partition key = aggregate id is a producer-side concern (`kgo.KeyPartitioner` uses the record key you set — set `Record.Key = []byte(departureID)` or `[]byte(bookingID)` per the seed's convention); franz-go doesn't need special config for this beyond setting the key.

## connect-go + buf Codegen for TypeScript (per downstream request)

1. `buf.gen.yaml` needs four plugins wired together: `protoc-gen-go` (Go structs), `protoc-gen-connect-go` (Go Connect service stubs, v1.18.1 via buf remote plugin or local `go install connectrpc.com/connect/cmd/protoc-gen-connect-go@latest`), `@bufbuild/protoc-gen-es` (TS message types, target `ts` not the older `js`), `@connectrpc/protoc-gen-connect-es` (TS Connect clients — **not** the deprecated `@bufbuild/protoc-gen-connect-es`).
2. Generated TS client is consumed in Next.js via `@connectrpc/connect-web` (browser/Node transport) creating a `createClient(ServiceName, transport)` — point the transport at the Kong-fronted BFF origin, not directly at internal services (matches the seed's "คุยกับ API Gateway เท่านั้น" guardrail).
3. Connect's protocol means the **same generated TS client works for debugging via plain `curl -H "Content-Type: application/json"` against the BFF**, which is the whole reason the seed picked connect-go over raw gRPC — verify this in Phase 0 with one real round trip before building on top of it.
4. Commit generated `gen/` output (Go + TS) to the repo per the seed's structure — avoids requiring buf network/plugin access in every CI job and every dev machine, only regenerate on proto change via `make proto-gen`.

## testcontainers-go for Postgres + Redpanda (per downstream request)

- `go get github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go` + `.../modules/postgres` + `.../modules/redpanda`, all released in lockstep at v0.44.x — keep them on the same version to avoid API-mismatch surprises.
- Postgres module: `postgres.Run(ctx, "postgres:17-alpine", postgres.WithDatabase(...), postgres.WithUsername(...), postgres.WithPassword(...))`, then run `goose` migrations against the returned DSN before each service's integration tests — this gives every service test its own throwaway Postgres 17 instance matching prod.
- Redpanda module: `redpanda.Run(ctx, "docker.redpandadata/redpanda:v25.x.x")` (pin to match your Compose dev-stack tag) — exposes a real Kafka-protocol broker for franz-go producer/consumer round-trip tests, including the capacity-race integration test's async side (if any event assertions are part of that test).
- Run these in CI (Jenkins) — confirm the Jenkins build agent has Docker socket access; this is a Phase-0 infra checkbox, not a code concern.

## Payment Provider: Opn (Omise) vs 2C2P

| Criterion | Opn (Omise) | 2C2P |
|---|---|---|
| Go SDK | `github.com/omise/omise-go` — actively published (last release Mar 2026), idiomatic Go client, includes a ready-made `WebhookHTTPHandler` that unmarshals `Event` objects from Omise's webhook POSTs | No first-party Go SDK found; integration is via their REST API (redirect-hosted checkout, embedded UI, or direct API) — you'd hand-roll the Go client and webhook verification yourself |
| PromptPay QR | First-class `Source`/`Charge` API for PromptPay, documented specifically for this flow (`docs.opn.ooo/promptpay`) | Also supports PromptPay (interoperable with regional QR too), but documentation is JS/mobile-SDK-first, not Go-first |
| Webhook maturity | Named `Event` object + signature-friendly handler helper in the SDK — meaningfully less code for the "webhook idempotent" requirement | Webhook exists but you're implementing verification/parsing from scratch against their API docs |
| Sandbox | Omise/Opn has a standard test-mode dashboard + test API keys, well-trodden path for SEA fintech integrations | 2C2P has a sandbox too but is oriented more toward enterprise/redirect-checkout integration flows |
| **Recommendation** | **Prefer Opn (Omise) for v1.** The existence of a maintained Go SDK with a webhook handler directly reduces the highest-risk part of Phase 4 (idempotent webhook handling) from "write and test HMAC verification + JSON parsing yourself" to "use the library's `WebhookHTTPHandler` and verify against test events." 2C2P may still be worth it later for enterprise/corporate-card volume or if the operator relationships specifically require it, but that's a Growth-phase (§8, phase 8) decision, not v1. | — |

Confidence: MEDIUM — based on published SDK/docs currency, not a hands-on sandbox integration test. Recommend spiking both against real sandbox credentials at the start of Phase 4 before finalizing (per the seed's own Key Decision: "ตัดสินใจตอน plan Phase 4"); this research narrows the choice but doesn't replace that spike.

## Cache/Lock: Redis License Note

Redis moved off BSD in March 2024 (RSALv2/SSPLv1), then added an **AGPLv3** option in May 2025 (Redis 8+) — AGPLv3 is OSI-approved open source. For a self-hosted service you operate and never redistribute (your case: EC2, Docker Compose, not shipping Redis to customers), AGPL's copyleft trigger (distributing modified source) essentially never fires — **plain Redis 8 is legally fine here.** That said, **Valkey** (BSD-3-Clause, Linux Foundation fork, AWS/Google/Oracle-backed) is protocol-compatible with `go-redis/v9` with zero code changes and removes the license question entirely at no cost — Valkey 9.1 (May 2026) is also measurably faster/leaner. Recommendation: **default to Valkey** for the "no reason not to" simplicity; Redis proper is not a blocker if you have another reason to prefer it (e.g. Redis-specific vector features you don't need here).

## Alternatives Considered

| Recommended | Alternative | When to Use Alternative |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| chi | stdlib `net/http.ServeMux` (Go 1.22+ pattern routing) | If you want zero router deps at all — Go 1.22+'s mux now does `GET /pier/{id}` style routing natively. You'd lose chi's middleware chain conventions (Recoverer, RequestID, Timeout), which you'd then hand-roll. Not worth it for 8 services; chi stays. |
| Kong (pinned OSS 3.9.1) | Traefik + Go BFF | If the Kong OSS licensing freeze turns out to block something you need (a plugin now Enterprise-only), or if you'd rather avoid tracking a frozen fork at all — the seed itself lists this as an equal option. Apache-2.0, no license cliff, but you move JWT verification logic into your own BFF code instead of a declarative plugin. |
| franz-go | `segmentio/kafka-go` | Never for this project — no transactional/exactly-once support, slower, and maintenance has been inconsistent; franz-go is strictly better here. |
| franz-go | `confluent-kafka-go` | If you need Confluent-specific enterprise features (Schema Registry deep integration) — but it's a cgo wrapper around librdkafka, meaning cross-compilation/Docker multi-stage builds get heavier. Not worth it when your events are already Protobuf via buf, not Confluent Schema Registry. |
| Redis 8 (AGPLv3) | Valkey 9.x (BSD-3) | Default recommendation is actually Valkey (see Cache section) — listed here as "alternative" only because the seed named "Redis" specifically. |
| PostgreSQL 17 | PostgreSQL 18 | If you want the new async I/O subsystem's read-throughput win (up to 3x on storage-bound reads) and are comfortable running a ~1-year-old major in solo-maintained prod. Either is fine; 17 is the more conservative pick. |
| skip2/go-qrcode | piglig/go-qr | If ticket QR generation ever becomes a measured hot path (unlikely at v1 booking volumes) — 3-4x faster, far fewer allocations, zero deps either way. |
| Opn (Omise) | 2C2P | If operator/business relationships specifically require 2C2P, or you need enterprise redirect-checkout flows at scale later — not a v1 concern. |
| Next.js 16 | Next.js 15 | If there's a hard reason (dependency not yet updated for 16, team familiarity) to stay one major behind — 15 is still fine, just not the current default for a fresh Sept 2026 project. |

## What NOT to Use

| Avoid | Why | Use Instead |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| `html5-qrcode` (for the staff scanner) | Unmaintained since 2023 (no releases since April 2023), wraps the also-unmaintained `zxing-js` | `qr-scanner` (nimiq), with native `BarcodeDetector` API as first choice where supported (Chrome/Edge/Android WebView — the staff-tablet environment) |
| `kong:latest` in Compose/prod | Will eventually resolve to a licensed-only Enterprise image once 3.10+ becomes "latest" | Explicitly pin `kong:3.9.1` (OSS) and upgrade deliberately, tracking Kong's OSS support discussions |
| `@bufbuild/protoc-gen-connect-es` | Effectively abandoned npm package (last publish ~3 years ago), superseded by a namespace move | `@connectrpc/protoc-gen-connect-es` |
| `segmentio/kafka-go` | No exactly-once/transactional support, weaker fit for the outbox+idempotent-consumer architecture already designed | `franz-go` |
| Debezium/CDC for outbox relay | Explicitly out of scope per the seed already — extra moving part (Kafka Connect cluster) not needed at this scale | Go outbox relay (poll+publish+mark), already the seed's decision — this research confirms it's still the right call for v1 |
| Kubernetes for v1 | Already out of scope per the seed; confirmed still correct — Docker Compose on one EC2 is the right complexity level for a solo dev at this stage, and the service-per-container boundary already makes a later ECS/EKS move mechanical, not a rewrite | Docker Compose → Jenkins → ECR → EC2 (as decided) |
| connect-go v2 module (`connectrpc.com/connect/v2`) | Still beta as of Sept 2026, API not final | v1 module (`connectrpc.com/connect`), supported indefinitely |

## Stack Patterns by Variant

**If Kong OSS 3.9.1's DB-less JWT plugin turns out insufficient (Phase 0 spike fails):**
- Fall back to Traefik (Apache-2.0, file/label-based dynamic config) + move JWT verification into the Go BFF middleware.
- Because the BFF already needs to "forward claims as trusted headers" per the seed's guardrail, this fallback is additive work in one place (BFF), not a service-layer rewrite.

**If you need vector search / advanced Redis-specific features later (Growth phase):**
- Stay on Redis proper (AGPLv3, fine for self-hosted) rather than Valkey, since Redis 8 has the more integrated vector/search story — this is a v8+ (Growth) decision, not v1.

**If Postgres 18's async I/O read win matters at launch scale (e.g. heavy concurrent search queries):**
- Use 18.6 instead of 17.x; the BFF's live-query search pattern (no projection service in v1) is read-heavy, so this is a legitimate reason to take the newer major if you want it — otherwise 17 is the safer default.

## Version Compatibility

| Package A | Compatible With | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| `connectrpc.com/connect@v1.20.0` | Go ≥1.25 | Minimum bumped in this release — do not try to pair with Go 1.23/1.24 toolchains; update `go.work`'s `go` directive accordingly. |
| `sqlc` (sql_package: pgx/v5) | `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5` | Stable pairing since sqlc 1.18; no known issues at current versions. |
| `testcontainers-go/modules/postgres` + `/modules/redpanda` | `testcontainers-go` core, same v0.44.x line | Released in lockstep — upgrade all three together, don't pin core and modules to different minors. |
| `franz-go` | Kafka protocol 0.8.0 through 4.4+, and Redpanda (Kafka-protocol-compatible) | No Redpanda-specific client needed; same franz-go code targets both Redpanda now and MSK later. |
| `go-redis/v9` | Both Redis (incl. AGPLv3 Redis 8) and Valkey (RESP-protocol compatible) | Client doesn't care which server you run; the license question is a deployment/legal decision, not a code one. |
| `@connectrpc/protoc-gen-connect-es` + `@bufbuild/protoc-gen-es` | Same `buf.gen.yaml`, both plugins needed | connect-es generates the *service* client, protoc-gen-es generates the *message* types they depend on — you need both, not one or the other. |
| Kong `kong:3.9.1` OSS | Postgres or DB-less | Use DB-less per the seed's dev-stack design (no separate `kong-database` container listed) — confirm the declarative `kong.yml` covers JWT plugin config, which it does in OSS. |
